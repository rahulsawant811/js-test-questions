Lesson 4 - Couting Elements - MaxCounters

Task description
You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:

increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
A non-empty zero-indexed array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.
For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

    (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)
The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

Write a function:

function solution(N, A);

that, given an integer N and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

The sequence should be returned as:

a structure Results (in C), or
a vector of integers (in C++), or
a record Results (in Pascal), or
an array of integers (in any other programming language).
For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.

Assume that:

N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.

Code:

function solution(N, A) {
    // write your code in JavaScript (Node.js 4.0.0)

    var result = new Array(N);
    var max = 0;
    var min = 0;

    for(var i=0; i<N; i++) {
        result[i] = 0;
    }

    for(var i=0; i<A.length; i++) {
        var op = A[i];
        if(op > N) {
            min = max;
        } else {
            result[A[i]-1] = Math.max(result[A[i]-1], min);
            max = Math.max(++result[A[i]-1], max);
        }
    }

    for(var i=0; i<result.length; i++) {
        result[i] = Math.max(result[i], min);
    }

    return result;
}
